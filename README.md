Python program, features tkinter interface using me.
Revisited python program for python 3.
Tkdnd, drag and drop for windows needs to be 64 bit, if python is 64 bit.
I put video to youtube about it. Change TKDND_LIBRARY to your tknd path in Fclass.
Fclass is the startup module to run the App.
Lots of bug fixing to satisfy python 3 requirements and changes in PIL.
All modules were installed with pip. Just look for error message and install next module.
